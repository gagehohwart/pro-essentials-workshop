### How is TypeScript different to JavaScript?

Typescript is strongly typed, and compiles down to JS when actually running the code. This allows for things like hard type checking to ensure what you are passing into a variable or method makes sense, and won't error out during browser/env testing.

Typescript is also written in away that allows you to utilize standard IDE tools like autocomplete and intellisense in your code seamlessly.

### Can you turn TypeScript into JavaScript?

Yes

### What kind of mistakes does TypeScript help prevent?

Unexpected typings, typos, etc

### Does TypeScript make your code run faster?

Maybe

### What is a 'type'?
